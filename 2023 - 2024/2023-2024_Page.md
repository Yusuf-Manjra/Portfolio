# Years 2023 to 2024

## Rebound Rivals (Work In Progress)

***"Rebound Rivals is a PC couch co-op chaotic vehicular sports game with bouncy physics that I developed as a part of a team in my FIanl Year Game Jam. It is planned for release on STEAM. The gameplay is inspired by Rocket League combined with Air Hockey with it's themes, visual design and additional features like traps and power-ups being inspired by Robot Wars."***

The game was developed in Unreal Engine 5.2 using entirely blueprints. The blueprints were used as some of the team were not confident in general C++ coding.

I worked as one of the main programmers, tasked mainly with coding main game requirements such as the bouncing interactions between players / environments as well as creating and prototyping potential gamemodes such as "Tug Of War" or "King Of The Hill".

I also helped develop prototypes of many core game features such as the traps and powerups that we wished to create.

The game is currently in active development using feedback gained from players at the University of Huddersfield, the GaMaYo at Tileyard North and the Game Republic Student Showcase at Staffordshire University in Stoke-On-Trent where we won 3rd place for the game design award given by Sumo Digital.

We have also submitted this project to The Rookie Awards to get the game more potential exposure and we are potentiallty looking at going to the multi-day GaMaYo event later in the year.
