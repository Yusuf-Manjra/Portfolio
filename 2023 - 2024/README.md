### Rebound Rivals (In Progress)

Worked as a main programmer tasked mainly with coding main game requirements such as the bouncing interactions between players / environments as well as creating and prototyping potential gamemodes such as "Tug Of War" or "King Of The Hill".
I also helped develop prototypes of many core game features such as the traps and powerups that we wished to create.

Currently in development using feedback gained from players at the University of Huddersfield, the GaMaYo at Tileyard North and the Game Republic Student Showcase at Staffordshire University in Stoke-On-Trent where we won 3rd place for the game design award given by Sumo Digital.

We have also submitted this project to The Rookie Awards to get the game more potential exposure.
